SUCCESS STORIES How 500,000 companies worldwide stay ahead of threats with Trend Micro The XDR platform allowed us to connect endpoints, network sensors, and email, providing a single screen for visibility and action. After doing some research, I realised no other platform offered the equivalent capability of Trend Micro Vision One. Our cybersecurity posture is significantly stronger than it was 4 years ago. Trend Vision One is amazing. It gives the ability to see and track a threat from potential to attack. We found Trend Vision One and Cloud App Security to secure our 100,000 Google users, easy to set up and deploywhich has been a major advantage. Trend focuses broadly on all security aspects of the multicloud, not just on one small piece. Thats exactly what the KNMI was looking for. Trend has allowed us to sleep at night knowing that its security solutions are running 247. Companies that dont take security seriously and invest wisely are taking on a much higher risk. We now have ongoing assurance that our cloud infrastructure is in a good and secure state. My team has gotten 20 percent of its time back, allowing me to leverage their quality and move from being reactive to being proactive. Since deploying Trend Micro, weve recorded millions of attacks, stopped 117,000 threats in one day, and had zero infections in 18 months. Trend Micro is always working, even while Im sleeping. Ricoh USA uses Trend to drive a securityfirst culture to protect its environment.
